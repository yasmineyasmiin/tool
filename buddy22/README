---------------------------------------------------------------------
--- REQUIREMENTS ----------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* A (not to old) C++ compiler
* A machine that supports 32 bit integers


---------------------------------------------------------------------
--- INSTALLING ------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Edit the file "config" to specify your compiler options and
where the package is to be installed.

3) type "make" to make the binary.

4) type "make install" to copy the BDD files to their appropriate
directories.

5) type "make examples" to make the examples


---------------------------------------------------------------------
--- USING -----------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming that the files "bdd.h" and "libbdd.a" are in directories
"/usr/local/include" and "/usr/local/lib" then the compile command
could be:

 g++ -I/usr/local/include myfile.cc -o myfile -L/usr/local/lib -lbdd

Your machine may be setup to use the above directories auto-
matically, so you might be able to do:

 g++ myfile.cc -o myfile -lbdd

--- FEEDBACK --------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Please do not hesitate to send any questions or bug reports to:

  Jorn Lind-Nielsen:  buddy@itu.dk
  (or maybe jorn_lind_nielsen@hotmail.com or jln@fjeldgruppen.dk)

It may take some time to get an answer since BuDDy do not have that
much focus any more - but I'll try to give a reasonable answer
in (finite) time.

New updates and other info can be found at:

Hope you find some use for this software
